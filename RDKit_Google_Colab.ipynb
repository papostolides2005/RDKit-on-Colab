There are different types of covalent bonds: single, double, and triple bonds, in which one, two, or three pairs of electrons respectively are shared between the bonded atoms.

For example, ethane has the chemical formula C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub> and the two carbon atoms are connected by a single bond, also known as a 'saturated' bond. Ethene also has two carbon atoms, but it has a double (or 'unsaturated') bond between the carbons, and the formula C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>. Ethane is saturated, while ethene is unsaturated.\n",

        "## Hydrogen Bonds\n",
        "\n",
        "[Hydrogen bonds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_bond) are weak, directional interactions that arise as a result of differences in [electronegativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronegativity) between hydrogen (less electronegative) and atoms like oxygen and nitrogen (more electronegative). The difference in electronegativity between two atoms in a bond causes the electrons in the bond(s) between the atoms to be distributed unequally, so one atom becomes slightly positively charged, and the other slightly negative. A hydrogen bond involves a hydrogen bond donor such as an N-H group, and a hydrogen bond acceptor such as an oxygen atom, and is often represented by dotted lines: N-H•••O. H-bonds while weak are highly directional: the angle from the H-bonding donor atom, via the H to the H-bonding acceptor tends to be ~180°. This leads to emergent local structure btween molecules, such as the tetrahedral lattice in water ice; or (secondary structure in proteins)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_secondary_structure] formed by adjacent backbone amide groups.\n",

These types of interactions are observed between postively (arginine, lysine and sometimes histidine sidechains) and negatively charged amino acid (aspartic and glutamic acids) side chains (and their N- and C-termini). It's also possible for small molecule drugs to form salt bridges to amino acids in proteins, *e.g.* tamiflu binding to neuraminidase spikes in influenza virus)\n",

Just like graphs, molecules can be linear, branched, or cyclic with the atoms arranged in *so called* rings. A saturated hydrocarbon 6-membered ring consists of six carbon atoms connected by six single bonds and is called *saturated*: this molecule is called \"cyclohexane\", and is an example of an \"aliphatic ring\"; it has the chemical formula C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub> But it is also possible to have a *unsaturated* 6-membered hydrocarbon ring with six carbons and alternating single and double bonds: this molecule is called \"benzene\", and is known as an \"[aromatic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aromatic_compound) ring\"; it has the chemical formula C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>6</sub>. [Aromatic rings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_aromatic_ring) feature heavily in small molecule drugs. One of the features of [aromaticity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aromaticity) are the rings of negative electron clouds above and below the plane of the atoms. Another feature is molecular shape. The electron density has been found to be shared equally between all six atoms in benzene, due to all six bond lengths in the ring having the same length. This 'aromaticity' offers benzene-like compounds a special stability which has significant effects in organic synthesis.\n",

Because it is possible to rotate connected atoms about a single bond, cyclohexane can adopt different [conformations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclohexane_conformation). The most stable is the *chair* conformation, and the least stable, highest energy state is the *boat* conformation; intermediate between these two is the *twist boat* conformation.\n",

In addition to these electrostatic interactions, there are *steric* interactions, governed by [shape complementarity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docking_(molecular)#Shape_complementarity), a bit like \"knobs\" fitting into \"holes\". Many of these concepts are embodied in protein-ligand [docking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docking_(molecular)) software, where a search of the conformational, translational, and orientational degrees of freedom of a protein and ligand is performed using a [scoring function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docking_(molecular)#Scoring_function) that quantifies the intermolecular and intramolecular interactions.\n",
